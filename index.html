            <h1>AA Preamble</h1>
            <p>
                AA Preamble: Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men & women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.  
                    The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.  There are no dues or fees for AA membership.  We are self-supporting through our own contributions.  AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage itself in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes.  Our primary purpose is to stay sober, and to help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.

            <p>
                This is a closed meeting of AA; attendance at closed meetings is limited to persons who have a desire to stop drinking. If you think you have a problem with alcohol, you are welcome to attend this meeting. We are glad you are all here—especially newcomers. We ask that all who participate confine their discussion to their problems with and recovery from alcohol. This group does not condone profanity, please respect by avoiding such language. When sharing, avoid cross-talk or taking responsibility for solving others’ problems. Please remember that anonymity is the spiritual foundation of AA’s traditions, ever reminding us that, “who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here let it stay here!”

                Group Conscience takes place on the last Wednesday of each quarter after the regular noon meeting. (Mar 25th, Jun 24th, Sep 30th, Dec 30th)
              The Keep Leaning Forward group feels that sponsorship and home group participation are vital to sobriety. If you need a sponsor, want to be a sponsor or want to make Keep Leaning Forward your home group, please send a message in chat or bring it up as a topic for the meeting. May I have a show of hands of everyone willing and able to be a sponsor or to discuss sponsorship?

                      Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it — then you are ready to take certain steps. 
                        <br><br>
                        At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely. 
                        <br><br>
                        Remember that we deal with alcohol — cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power — that One is God. May you find Him now! 
                        <br><br>
                        Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon. 
                        <br><br>
                        Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery: 
                        <ol>
                          <li>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol — that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
                          <li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. </li>
                          <li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. </li>
                          <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. </li>
                          <li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. </li>
                          <li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. </li>
                          <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. </li>
                          <li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
                          <li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. </li>
                          <li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. </li>
                          <li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
                          <li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. </li>
                        </ol>
                        Many of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through with it.’’ Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:
                        <br><br>
                        (a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives. 
                        (b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism. 
                        (c) That God could and would if He were sought.

                                    Most of us have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics. No person likes to think he is bodily and mentally different from his fellows. Therefore, it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized by countless vain attempts to prove we could drink like other people. The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.
                                    <br><br>We learned that we had to fully concede to our innermost selves that we were alcoholics.  This is the first step in recovery. The delusion that we are like other people, or presently may be, has to be smashed.
                                    <br><br>We alcoholics are men and women who have lost the ability to control our drinking.  We know that no real alcoholic ever recovers control. All of us felt at times that we were regaining control, but such intervals—usually brief—were inevitably followed by still less control, which led in time to pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization. We are convinced to a man that alcoholics of our type are in the grip of a progressive illness. Over any considerable period, we get worse, never better.
                                    <br><br>We are like men who have lost their legs; they never grow new ones. Neither does there appear to be any kind of treatment which will make alcoholics of our kind like other men. We have tried every imaginable remedy. In some instances, there has been brief recovery, followed always by a still worse relapse. Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism agree there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out   of an alcoholic. Science may one day accomplish this, but it hasn’t done so yet.

If you think you have a problem with alcohol, you are welcome to attend this meeting. We are glad you are all here—especially newcomers. We ask that all who participate confine their discussion to their problems with and recovery from alcohol. This group does not condone profanity, please respect by avoiding such language. When sharing, avoid cross-talk or taking responsibility for solving others’ problems. Please remember that anonymity is the spiritual foundation of AA’s traditions, ever reminding us that, “who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here let it stay here!”

                      Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it — then you are ready to take certain steps. 
                        <br><br>
                        At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely. 
                        <br><br>
                        Remember that we deal with alcohol — cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power — that One is God. May you find Him now! 
                        <br><br>
                        Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon. 
                        <br><br>
                        Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery: 
                        <ol>
                          <li>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol — that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
                          <li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. </li>
                          <li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. </li>
                          <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. </li>
                          <li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. </li>
                          <li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. </li>
                          <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. </li>
                          <li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
                          <li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. </li>
                          <li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. </li>
                          <li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
                          <li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. </li>
                        </ol>
                        Many of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through with it.’’ Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:
                        <br><br>
                        (a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives. 
                        (b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism. 
                        (c) That God could and would if He were sought.

                        Most of us have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics. No person likes to think he is bodily and mentally different from his fellows. Therefore, it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized by countless vain attempts to prove we could drink like other people. The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.
                        <br><br>We learned that we had to fully concede to our innermost selves that we were alcoholics.  This is the first step in recovery. The delusion that we are like other people, or presently may be, has to be smashed.
                        <br><br>We alcoholics are men and women who have lost the ability to control our drinking.  We know that no real alcoholic ever recovers control. All of us felt at times that we were regaining control, but such intervals—usually brief—were inevitably followed by still less control, which led in time to pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization. We are convinced to a man that alcoholics of our type are in the grip of a progressive illness. Over any considerable period, we get worse, never better.
                        <br><br>We are like men who have lost their legs; they never grow new ones. Neither does there appear to be any kind of treatment which will make alcoholics of our kind like other men. We have tried every imaginable remedy. In some instances, there has been brief recovery, followed always by a still worse relapse. Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism agree there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out   of an alcoholic. Science may one day accomplish this, but it hasn’t done so yet.
